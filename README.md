# Linear media player

### Overview

Create a media player for playing a playlist of audio files.

### Instructions

Fork this repo and submit a URL to your repo upon completion.

### Requirements

You are going to be implementing a media player that can play a playlist of audio files, display info on the currently playing track and supporting basic functionality like play/pause, next track, etc. This is intentionally left vague to allow you to take this in a direction that you find interesting.

We are looking for a final product that is polished and tasteful.

### Playlist data

The playlist data is stored in `src/data/playlists.json`. It includes a list of audio files some associated metadata.

### Expected time to complete

Plan on spending 2-4 hours to complete this exercise.
